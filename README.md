# 🎮 3D Super Mario Game

Inspired by the Original Super Mario Game, I made my own. My 3D Super Mario Game is a single level 3D adventure where the main character collects coins and avoids obstacles in a custom designed game world. Built for fun and challenge, the game features smooth movement controls, real-time feedback, and win/lose conditions.

## 🧍 Main Character

- The player can choose between first-person or third-person perspective.
- Controls:
  - Move: WASD or arrow keys
  - Run: Shift
  - Jump: Space
- The character starts with 3 lives.

## 🌍 Game World

### 🪙 Coins
- At least 6 gold colored coins are placed throughout the level.
- Some coins float in mid-air and require jumping to collect.
- Coins rotate automatically to make them easier to spot.

### 🚧 Obstacles
- The level includes 5 or more red colored obstacles.
- Some obstacles must be jumped over to be avoided.
- Contact with an obstacle:
  - Subtracts 1 life
  - Restarts the level

### 🏙️ Environment
- The game world is a maze.
- One level.
- Coin placements are varied for both easy and challenging gameplay.

## 🎯 Gameplay

- The objective is to collect all coins while avoiding obstacles.
- Coin collection:
  - Causes the coin to disappear
  - Increments and displays the coin count in the console
- Win Condition: When all coins are collected, display "You Win!" in the console and exit the game.
- Lose Condition: When the player loses all 3 lives, display "Game Over!" in the console and exit.
